        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Tom Krois, i am a sophomore at the Univeristy of Rhode island.
            <br> I am a finance major but am very interested in double majoring in Computer Science. I am from Trumbull, Connecticut and prior to college did nothing related to Computer Science so it is fairly fresh to me.
